# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
Welcome to my Convex Optimization project

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
One of the difficult things that I had to understand was higher mathematics. 
It was difficult for me to understand the formula and how it works.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I solved this problem with the help of a mentor. 
He helped me understand how it works


## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
there is nothing to install here, you just need to compile


## Usage
How does it work?
In this project I use 3 libraries: 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib' and 'SciPy'.
'NumPy' - for creating arrays
'Matplotlib' - for visualization
'SciPy' - for solving mathematical problems

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
